## References 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

❗️**Title**: `Fashion Demon`

❗**Purpose**: `A 2D sliding landscape game where players customize their characters, evade a chasing NPC, and navigate obstacles while enjoying background music. The player can jump, run, and slide to escape and protect their fashion!
    - Customize character's fashion
    - Evade a chasing NPC
    - Navigate through challenging obstacles
    - Enjoy background music
Key Features:
    - Player customization (clothes, shoes)
    -  NPC chase mechanics
    - Sliding 2D landscape
    - Player movement (jump, run, slide)
`

❗️**Source Assignment(s)**: 
`Reference: 
The Legend of Tuna: Breath of Catnip,
Class examples for player movement and collision detection,
Homework 3: Adding audio to Python projects.
Turtle Graphics Homework 4
`

❗️**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:

❗️**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
  Branch 1 name: Clarkk2 -
  player-actions  
  npc-mechanics: Develop NPC chase logic 
  obstacle-handling 
  ui-customization`: Create character customization interface 
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. 🙃

Reflect on what you’ve done so far. How’s it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    **Feelings for the beginning: I’m excited about the project but slightly worried about managing all the interactions between the classes. I plan to start small with basic player movement and build on that step by step. I’ve created some placeholder assets for testing, and the overall plan feels manageable.

** /project-directory
  - main.py
  - player.py
  - npc.py
  - fashion_item.py
  - sound_manager.py
  - game_manager.py
  - obstacle.py
  - item.py
  - test_suite.py**
```
## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

❗️**Completion Percentage**: `0 - 100%`

❗️**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    **Replace this text with your reflection
```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ❗User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 

### ❗Errors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ❗Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
